# Balanced Binary Search Tree Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of a balanced binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript. The BST supports common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and rebalancing. The tree automatically maintains its balance to ensure efficient performance for various operations.

# Features
Insertion: Insert new nodes while maintaining the BST properties.
Deletion: Delete nodes and properly rearrange the tree.
Traversal: Perform in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversals.
Height Calculation: Calculate the height of a node.
Depth Calculation: Calculate the depth of a node.
Balance Check: Check if the tree is balanced.
Rebalance: Rebalance the tree to maintain efficient operations.

# Skills Demonstrated
Data Structures: Understanding and implementation of binary search trees.
Algorithms: Implementation of various tree traversal algorithms.
Recursion: Use of recursion to perform tree operations.
Problem Solving: Handling edge cases and ensuring the tree remains balanced
